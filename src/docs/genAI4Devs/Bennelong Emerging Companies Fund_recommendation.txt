1. **Buy:** The fund has shown strong performance in the current fiscal year and has a positive outlook for the long term. Investors looking for exposure to small and micro-cap companies in Australia and New Zealand may find this fund attractive.

2. **Hold:** For existing investors, it is recommended to hold the investment, especially considering the positive performance in the current fiscal year. Monitoring the fund's performance in the short term is advised due to recent negative performance in shorter time frames.

3. **Sell:** If investors have a short-term investment horizon or are risk-averse, they may consider selling due to the recent negative performance in the 30 and 90-day periods.

### Summary:
The Bennelong Emerging Companies Fund has demonstrated strong performance in the current fiscal year, making it a viable option for long-term investors. However, caution is advised for short-term investors due to recent negative performance. The market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, and the fund's exposure to small and micro-cap companies in Australia and New Zealand provides a unique investment opportunity.

Investors should consider their investment horizon and risk tolerance when making a decision. For those with a long-term perspective, the fund presents a promising opportunity, while short-term investors may need to exercise caution.
