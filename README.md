# CrewAI SaaS for Investment Analysis using LLMs

## Introduction
Welcome to the CrewAI SaaS for Investment Analysis project! This project builds upon the CrewAI Stock Analysis project, extending it to a full-fledged SaaS (Software as a Service) application. Using the CrewAI framework, this service automates the investment analysis process by orchestrating autonomous AI agents to collaborate and execute complex tasks efficiently. The SaaS functionality is powered by FastAPI micro-services.

This repository has been created for demo purposes for the 'GenAI for Developers' Meetup on July 11, 2024, titled "Unlock the Power of Generative AI with CrewAI."

## Inspiration
The inspiration for CrewAI SaaS comes from [this video by @Kno2gether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFZHpFuzcBE&t=854s). You can find more content from @Kno2gether on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Kno2gether).
